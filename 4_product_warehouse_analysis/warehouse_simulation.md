#### Scenario A
- **Storage capacity**: 1.2x multiplier (145.6 units average)
- **Staff level**: High (80 orders/day)
- **Replenishment**: Daily (5% rate)
- **Description**: High capacity with frequent restocking

#### Scenario B
- **Storage capacity**: 0.8x multiplier (97.0 units average)
- **Staff level**: Low (20 orders/day)
- **Replenishment**: Bi-weekly (25% rate)
- **Description**: Reduced capacity with lifecycle prioritization

#### Scenario C
- **Storage capacity**: 1.1x multiplier (133.7 units average)
- **Staff level**: Medium (40 orders/day)
- **Replenishment**: Predictive (20% for Growth, 10% for others)
- **Description**: Predictive restocking with moderate capacity

### 3. Simulation Execution
Ran discrete event simulation for each scenario:
- **Daily order processing**: Batch processing by product
- **Inventory management**: Real-time stock updates
- **Staff capacity constraints**: Daily order limits
- **Replenishment logic**: Scenario-specific frequencies and rates

- **Utilization rate**: 88.3% (lower efficiency)
- **Total orders**: 1,572 orders processed
- **Orders fulfilled**: 1,462 (93% success)
- **Key advantage**: Intelligent restocking

#### Scenario B - Worst Performer
- **Fulfillment rate**: 63.1% (significant issues)
- **Utilization rate**: 94.1% (high efficiency)
- **Total orders**: 1,572 orders processed
- **Orders fulfilled**: 992 (63% success)
- **Key issue**: Capacity constraints

### Performance Metrics Summary
- **Best fulfillment**: Scenario A (100.0%)
- **Best utilization**: Scenario A (96.2%)
- **Worst fulfillment**: Scenario B (63.1%)
- **Lowest utilization**: Scenario C (88.3%)

## Business Insights

### Insight 1: Capacity is Critical
The significant performance gap between scenarios demonstrates:
- **High capacity (Scenario A)**: 100% fulfillment vs. 63% (Scenario B)
- **Capacity multiplier impact**: 1.2x vs. 0.8x makes 37% difference
- **Storage investment justification**: Clear ROI for capacity expansion

### Insight 2: Staff Level Optimization
Staff capacity directly impacts fulfillment:
- **High staff (80 orders/day)**: 100% fulfillment
- **Medium staff (40 orders/day)**: 93% fulfillment
- **Low staff (20 orders/day)**: 63% fulfillment
- **Staff investment priority**: Critical for performance

### Insight 3: Replenishment Strategy Effectiveness
Different replenishment approaches show varying results:
- **Daily replenishment**: 100% fulfillment (Scenario A)
- **Weekly replenishment**: 93% fulfillment (Baseline)
- **Predictive replenishment**: 93% fulfillment (Scenario C)
- **Bi-weekly replenishment**: 63% fulfillment (Scenario B)

### Insight 4: Predictive Restocking Potential
Scenario C shows promise despite lower utilization:
- **Same fulfillment rate** as baseline (93%)
- **Lower utilization** (88.3% vs. 93.0%)
- **Cost efficiency opportunity**: Better resource allocation
- **Future optimization potential**: Algorithm improvement needed

### Insight 5: Risk Management Implications
All scenarios show 0 stockout events, indicating:
- **Conservative inventory policies** working effectively
- **Safety stock adequacy** across all configurations
- **Potential overstocking** that could be optimized
- **Opportunity for inventory reduction** strategies
