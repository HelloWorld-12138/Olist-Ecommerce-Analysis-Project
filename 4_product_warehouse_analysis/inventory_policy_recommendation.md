# Inventory Policy Recommendation 

## Overview
- **Execution Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Update Date**: 2025-06-30
- **Main Purpose**: Generate personalized inventory policies for each product based on lifecycle stage, sales volatility, and risk assessment
- **Input Data**: Lifecycle labels (6,051 products), Risk flags (6,051 products), Inventory metrics (6,051 products), Monthly sales (139,173 records)
- **Output Files**: inventory_policy_matrix.csv (6,051 products), policy_matrix_reference.csv, 3 visualization files

## Analysis Process

### 1. Sales Volatility Calculation
Computed coefficient of variation (CV) for each product:
- **Average CV**: 0.416 (moderate volatility)
- **CV range**: 0.000 - 1.798
- **Volatility categorization**:
  - Low: 1,658 products (27.4%) - CV < 0.3
  - Medium: 2,746 products (45.4%) - CV 0.3-0.6
  - High: 1,647 products (27.2%) - CV > 0.6

### 2. Policy Matrix Definition
Created comprehensive policy matrix with 4 lifecycle stages × 3 volatility levels:

#### Policy Components
- **Reorder frequency**: Weekly, Bi-weekly, Monthly
- **Safety stock percentage**: 5% - 40% based on risk level
- **Review strategy**: Fixed Interval, Dynamic Recalibration, Just-in-Time, Just-in-Time + Review

### 3. Policy Assignment and Risk Adjustment
Applied policies based on lifecycle stage and volatility, then adjusted for risk flags:
- **Stockout risk products**: Increased safety stock by 50%, weekly reorder, Just-in-Time review
- **Overstock risk products**: Reduced safety stock by 50%, monthly reorder, Fixed Interval review
- **Total adjustments**: 352 products (5.8% of portfolio)

## Key Results

### Policy Distribution

- **Fixed Interval**: 396 products (6.5%) - Traditional approach

### Safety Stock Distribution
- **0-10%**: 394 products (6.5%) - Minimal safety stock
- **11-20%**: 1,612 products (26.6%) - Low safety stock
- **21-30%**: 2,401 products (39.7%) - Moderate safety stock
- **31-50%**: 1,487 products (24.6%) - High safety stock

### Risk-Adjusted Policies

### Policy by Lifecycle Stage

#### Growth Stage (5,355 products)
- **High volatility**: 1,529 products - Weekly reorder, 40% safety stock
- **Medium volatility**: 2,444 products - Weekly reorder, 25% safety stock
- **Low volatility**: 1,382 products - Bi-weekly reorder, 15% safety stock

#### Maturity Stage (550 products)
- **High volatility**: 62 products - Weekly reorder, 25% safety stock
- **Medium volatility**: 212 products - Bi-weekly reorder, 15% safety stock
- **Low volatility**: 276 products - Monthly reorder, 10% safety stock

#### Decline Stage (146 products)
- **High volatility**: 56 products - Bi-weekly reorder, 15% safety stock
- **Medium volatility**: 90 products - Monthly reorder, 10% safety stock

## Business Insights

### Insight 1: High-Frequency Reorder Dominance
66.8% of products assigned weekly reorder frequency indicates:
- **High demand volatility** across the portfolio
- **Need for rapid response** to market changes
- **Supply chain optimization** requirements for frequent replenishment

### Insight 2: Just-in-Time Strategy Prevalence
43.2% of products use Just-in-Time review strategy, suggesting:
- **Lean inventory management** approach
- **Real-time demand monitoring** capabilities
- **Efficient supply chain** infrastructure

### Insight 3: Risk-Based Policy Differentiation
Significant policy differences based on risk flags:
- **Stockout risk**: 49.5% safety stock vs. 24.9% stable
- **Overstock risk**: 6.4% safety stock vs. 24.9% stable
- **Effective risk mitigation** through policy customization

### Insight 4: Volatility-Driven Policy Design
Policy distribution closely follows volatility patterns:
- **High volatility**: Weekly reorder, high safety stock
- **Medium volatility**: Weekly/Bi-weekly reorder, moderate safety stock
- **Low volatility**: Monthly reorder, low safety stock

### Insight 5: Lifecycle Stage Optimization
Clear policy differentiation by lifecycle stage:
- **Growth**: Aggressive policies for high-demand products
- **Maturity**: Balanced policies for stable products
- **Decline**: Conservative policies for declining products

## Technical Details

### Volatility Calculation Methodology
- **Coefficient of variation**: Standard deviation / mean for non-zero sales months
- **Minimum data requirement**: 2 months of sales data for calculation
- **Categorization thresholds**: 0.3 and 0.6 CV boundaries
- **Data quality**: Filtered zero-sales months for accurate volatility measurement

### Policy Matrix Design
- **12 policy combinations**: 4 lifecycle stages × 3 volatility levels
- **Risk adjustment logic**: 50% increase/decrease based on risk flags
- **Rounding methodology**: Integer safety stock percentages
- **Default policies**: Fallback for unknown combinations
