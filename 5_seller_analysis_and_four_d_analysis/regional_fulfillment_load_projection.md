### 4. Product Lifecycle Influence Integration
- **Lifecycle Stage Distribution**: Growth, maturity, and decline product counts by state
- **Growth Contribution**: Weighted contribution of growth products to fulfillment load
- **State-wise Product Mix**: Product lifecycle diversity analysis

### 5. Fulfillment Projection Construction
- **Component Normalization**: Customer demand, seller load, and product contribution normalized to 1000-point scale
- **Weighted Integration**: Combined projection using all three components
- **Load Distribution Analysis**: High, medium, and low load state classification

- **Average Seller Fulfillment Load**: 44,626.4

## Business Insights

### 1. Geographic Concentration
- **Primary Hub**: São Paulo dominates with 3,000 projected load units
- **Secondary Centers**: Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro form secondary fulfillment hubs
- **Regional Distribution**: 92.6% of states have low load requirements (<500 units)

### 2. Customer Demand Patterns
- **Active Customer Distribution**: Concentrated in major metropolitan areas
- **Lifecycle Stage Balance**: Mix of active, at-risk, and new customers across regions
- **Demand Forecasting**: Weighted customer demand provides realistic capacity planning basis

### 3. Seller Complexity Analysis
- **Growth-Oriented Sellers**: High concentration in SP, MG, and RJ
- **Product Growth Impact**: Average 446.3 growth products per state indicates active expansion
- **Fulfillment Load Correlation**: Strong correlation between seller activity and projected load

### 4. Product Lifecycle Influence
- **Growth Product Concentration**: Major states show higher growth product counts
- **Lifecycle Diversity**: Balanced mix of growth, maturity, and decline products
- **Strategic Implications**: Growth products significantly impact fulfillment requirements

## Technical Details

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Cleaning**: Standardized state names and lifecycle stage classifications
2. **Aggregation Logic**: Multi-level aggregation by state, seller, and product categories
3. **Normalization**: Min-max scaling to 1000-point system for component integration
4. **Integration Strategy**: Weighted combination of customer, seller, and product factors

### Quality Assurance
- **Data Validation**: All input datasets verified for completeness and consistency
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and handled extreme values in load calculations
- **Cross-Validation**: Results validated against known geographic and economic patterns

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Time**: Efficient processing of 96,683 customer and 2,985 seller records
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized data structures for large-scale analysis
- **Scalability**: Framework supports expansion to additional regions or time periods

## Output Files
