# Week 2 â€“ Step 5: Holiday-Sensitive Product Analysis

## Dataset Overview

This analysis identifies products and categories that experience significant changes in demand during holidays compared to regular days. It combines and processes the following datasets:

- `orders_with_holidays.csv`: Contains holiday-annotated order information.
- `olist_order_items_dataset.csv`: Provides item-level order and price data.
- `olist_products_dataset.csv`: Links products to their category.
- `product_category_name_translation.csv`: Translates category names to English.

**Filtering Criteria:**

- Only holidays with at least **10 orders** were included.
- Only products and categories with **30+ total orders** were analyzed to reduce noise.

## Methodology

Each product and category was evaluated for holiday sensitivity using the following metrics:

- `holiday_count`, `regular_count`: Number of orders placed during holidays vs. regular days.
- `holiday_ratio`, `regular_ratio`: Normalized ratio of demand across holiday vs. regular orders.
- `lift`: Defined as  
  \[
  \text{Lift} = \frac{\text{holiday\_ratio} + 1e^{-6}}{\text{regular\_ratio} + 1e^{-6}}
  \]  
  A lift value > 1.5 indicates high holiday sensitivity.

| `top10_holiday_sensitive_categories.png`       | Bar chart of top 10 categories by lift              |
| `holiday_lift_bubble_chart.png`                | Bubble chart of lift vs total orders by category    |

### Highlight: `holiday_lift_bubble_chart.png`

This scatter plot visualizes:

- **X-axis**: Total orders (holiday + regular)  
- **Y-axis**: Holiday lift  
- **Bubble size/color**: Scaled by total volume and lift value  

It helps distinguish between niche but responsive categories (`tablets_printing_image`) and those with both lift and scale (`garden_tools`, `consoles_games`).

## Key Insights

1. **Holiday-sensitive categories** like `consoles_games`, `perfumery`, and `garden_tools` show a **lift > 1.5**, suggesting they perform significantly better during holidays.
2. Several individual SKUs (perfumes, toys, game consoles) saw more than **5x demand increase**, indicating strong promotional potential.
3. **Lower-volume but high-lift categories** may benefit from targeted exposure during key seasonal events.
4. Some categories (e.g., `computers`, `home_construction`) are niche but reveal behavioral shifts that could inform specialized campaigns.

## Recommendations

- Promote high-lift categories/products in pre-holiday campaigns (e.g., Black Friday, Christmas).
- Adjust pricing and inventory strategy to capitalize on predictable holiday surges.
- Monitor and refine forecasts for sensitive SKUs to improve fulfillment accuracy.

## Output Summary

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `holiday_sensitive_products.csv` | Product-level lift and ratios |
| `holiday_sensitive_categories.csv` | Category-level sensitivity metrics |
| `top10_holiday_sensitive_categories.png` | Lift comparison for categories |
